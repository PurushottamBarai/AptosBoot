# 📂 Decentralized FileStorage on Aptos

A simple Move smart contract that enables decentralized storage of file metadata using IPFS hashes — deployed on the Aptos blockchain.

---

## 📜 Description

This project implements a minimalistic smart contract to securely store and retrieve **IPFS hashes** of files on-chain.  
It acts as a decentralized file registry that verifies data ownership and enables metadata verification without relying on centralized servers.

The contract is written in **Move** and deployed on the **Aptos Devnet**.

---

## 🎯 Vision

To create a **trustless, transparent, and verifiable file metadata registry** that empowers users to:

- Prove ownership of files  
- Prevent unauthorized tampering  
- Verify content integrity using IPFS hashes  

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

- 🔄 Multi-file support per user  
- ⏱ Timestamp and versioning of uploads  
- 🗂 Public file directories  
- 🔐 Access control / encryption  
- 🧩 Frontend integration (React + IPFS uploader)
